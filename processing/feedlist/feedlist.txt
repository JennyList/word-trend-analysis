#RSS feed list
#Simply list feed URLs here
# A # at the start of the line indicates a comment that will be ignored.
#
# All entries are fed through PHP's filter_var($url, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL) function
# to check whether they are a URL or not before trying to retrieve them.
#
#
# Example feed URLs. Replace these with your own feed list
